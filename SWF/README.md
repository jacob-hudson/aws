# Simple Workflow Service (SWF)

## Basics
- Makes it easy to build applications that coordinate work across distributed components
- A task represents a unit of work that is performed by a component of an application
- SWF stores tasks, assigns them to workers, monitors progress, and maintains state

## Workflows
- Workflows coordincate and manage the execution of activities that can be run asynchronously across multiple computing devices
- When designing a workflow, analyze component tasks, which are activities in SWF

### Workflow Domains
- Domains scope SWF resources within an AWS account
- A domain must be specified for all components of a workflow
- Workflows in different domains can not interact

### Workflow History
- Detailed, complete, and consistent record of every event that occured since the workflow execution started
- An event is a discrete change in a workflow execution's state

## Actors
- Actors are programmable features
- Types of actors
  - Workflow starters - initiates wrokflow executions
  - Deciders - logic that coordincates tasks in a workflow
  - Activity workers - single process or thread that performs a task

## Tasks
- Types of tasks for activity workers and deciders
  - activity tasks - contains all information needed to perform its function
  - AWS Lambda - executes in AWS Lambda instead of as an SWF activity
  - Decision task - tells the decider that the state of the workflow execution has changed, contains the current workflow history

### Task Lists
- Organizes the various tasks associated with a workflow
- Task lists are dynamic queues
- Scheduling the task creates the task list if it doesn't already exist

## Long Polling
- The decider or activity workers periodically initiates communication with SWF
- Long pulling works well for high-volume task processing

## Object Identifiers
- SWF Objects are uniquely identified by workflow type, activity type, decision and activity tasks, and workflow execution:
  - Registered workflows are identified by domain, name, and version
  - Registered activities are identified by domain, name, and version
  - Each task is identified with a unique task token generated by SWF
  - A single execution is identified by the domain, workflow ID, and run ID

## Workflow Execution Closure
- After workflow execution begins, it is open
- Open workflows can be closed a completed, canceled, failed, or timed out
- The decider, the admin of the workflow, or SWF can close a workflow execution
